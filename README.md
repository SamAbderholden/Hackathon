# Coverage Compass

Coverage Compass is a web application developed during BlasterHacks, a hackathon sponsored by Colorado School of Mines. This application empowers users to swiftly and efficiently search their local area to identify medical providers that accept their insurance, thereby avoiding the inconvenience of insurance denial, especially in urgent situations.

Designed with user experience in mind, Coverage Compass ensures that in times of need, individuals can secure the healthcare services they require without the added stress of navigating insurance complexities.
